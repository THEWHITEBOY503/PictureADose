## ðŸš§ UNDER CONSTRUCTION ðŸš§
This project is in its infancy, and as such has limited information and no working code. This repository serves to publicly keep track of this app's progress and roadmap.

## What is Picture A Dose?
Picture A Dose is an app I thought up while attending Camp Sweeney. Getting ideas from my [TM-ImageClassifier](https://github.com/THEWHITEBOY503/TM-ImageClassifier) and [NutriMind](https://github.com/THEWHITEBOY503/NutriMind) projects, this app would take a picture of your plate, use an AI model to classify the different food items on your plate, use GPS to narrow down where you're eating, make an API requeast to retreive the nutrition information, add up all the carb information and calculate an insulin dosage using pre-programmed insulin-to-carb ratios. 

## Progress updates
### July 15th: Picture A Dose project began development.
### June 28th: Planning for Picture A Dose begins.
